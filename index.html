	<h2>Week #1 Blog Entry</h2>
		<p class="blogBody1">Upon reflection, my first week of software school seems like a blur. So much new content, so many new faces, so many instructors, just so many things. I've reviewed HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript material that I went over before class, and then the instructors gave new info and exercises as a buffer to see where the class as a whole was at. We learned bacis CSS-101 styling, we learned what a group project would look like, and even began working on one. Friday, I was assigned to a group of four people and we were given the task to plan and develop a working static website. Each of us briefly talked about out tasks, and almost immediately began working. I believed I had finished my code before the end of the day, and after pushing it up to gitHUB, which I still struggle with, realized that the gorup was far from done. However, I was excited to work with them to figure out how to complete our task.

		<h2>Week #2 Blog Entry</h2>
		<p class="blogBody2">Week two was a bit more intensive in regards to group projects. We were off school on Monday for labor day, and came back on tuesday with the day to work on and complete our first group project to be presented on wednesday. Putting the finishing touch on the first website proved to be a tad difficult, as my group and I worked from the start of class to its finish. Eventually, we figured out the basic JS requirements that were needed and we all felt confident in our final product to be able to present. I was chosen by the group the next morning as our presenter, and upon patiently waiting for our group's turn, I, to the best of my ability, showed the class our product, the things we (as a group) were proud of, the things that were difficult, and the code is took to make it all come to life. It went very well looking back, and I know I atleast learned a lot. After everyone finished, Joe, our lead instructor, broke things down for us in how it's one of his greatest tasks to make us all excellent team members in our future careers. How to work with other people, especially in difficult circimstances, while maintaining clear communication and practicing empathy- will be the roots of being a fantastic team member. Those two concepts really stuck out to me, and personally through my life story I have had to take a true look at and impliment communication and and empathy for more aspecs of my life. Anyways, back to the blog. After the lunch break, we were put into new teams to execute the exact same group project, yet with new members and new ways to go about the task structure. We spent the second half of class that day planning what my new group wanted our website to be, all thursday throughout class working and building the website, and we presented it to the class friday morning. Aside from the average git and gitHUB issues I, personally, always run into as well as the group, there were no major issues and our website looked really good. A team member presented it to the class and we all felt proud of it. After each group presented their project, Joe took us through again how important it is to be able to communicate and work effectively with team members- as in our future the majority of us will have to work in teams. We then split up for lunch, and I came back to class to work on this blog. After revamping my page and adding an entry, I went and worked / reviewed JS and CSS, as I was still wanting to practice and get better in those areas before the class really takes off into uncharted waters.</p>
